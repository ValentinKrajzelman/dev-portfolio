                    Im a dev from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Im currently studing cibersecurity, in the UP.<br />
                    I started coding back in 2019 exploring diferents languages and technologies, from the moment i discovered Javascript and web development i didnt look back and
                    eventually decided to learn the MERN stack which is currently what i use for all my projects, im looking to expand the stack with next.js, typescript,
                    and other cool technologies!
